<ul>
    <li>The Tic Tac Toe Project is a solo project that consisted of creating a "Tic Tac Toe" video game that can check for wins, draws, update them, and repopulate upon refreshing the page by utilizing localStorage and JSON</li>
    <li>I was given full creative control with the project's design</li>
</ul>

            <li>Adds icons when the boxes are clicked</li>
            <li>Identifies and reflects wins and draws</li>
            <li>Logs the amount of wins per player</li>
